Given two polynomial numbers represented by a linked list. Write a function that add polynomial equations.
1. 1x^4 + 10x^3 + 7x^2 + 3x^1 + 1x^0
2. 1x^7 + 1x^6 + 7x^3 + 10x^2 + 2x^1 + 8x^0

result = 1x^7 + 1x^6 + 1x^4 + 17x^3 + 17x^2 + 5x^1 + 9x^0

gcc Polynomial_Addition.c -Wall -o Polynomial_Addition 
./Polynomial_Addition
